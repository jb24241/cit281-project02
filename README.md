# CIT281 Project 2

## Overview

Project goals and outcomes:

1. Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo).
2. Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring.
3. Use git via Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
4. Create and use a .gitignore file.
5. Utilize diff split screen.

## Deliverables

- `lab-02.zip`
- `p2-random.js`
- `p2-random-files.txt`
- `p2-random-commits.txt`
- `p2-expressions.js`
- `p2-vscode-diff.png`

These files should be placed in your `cit281/p2` folder and zipped into `p2.zip`.

## Summary

In Project 2, the focus was on using Git to manage version control for a JavaScript project. The project involved creating a new repository, adding and committing files, and refactoring code to use more modern JavaScript syntax. This project reinforced the importance of version control in software development and provided hands-on experience with Git and GitHub.
